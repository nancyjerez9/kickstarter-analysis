# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview
Preforming analysis for Kickstarter data to uncover trends on theater plays for Louise's "Fever" play. 

## Analysis and Challenges
I used my analysis to generate images and charts which represented the most successful launches and how the goals of each play varied between the goal ranges. The only challenge I ran into was figuring out how to create the pivot table with data that best represented the number of successful, failed and canceled plays. 

## Results

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
Two conclusions that I was able to analyze from this line chart is that the most successful launches were in July and the most failed launches were in the month of August. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the Outcomes vs. Goals chart, I can conclude that the plays with a higher goal failed, while plays that had a lower goal were more successful.

### Limitations
Some limitations in this dataset included information on plays all around the globe. If the data focused on plays in only the country where the play is supposed to be held, the data would be more accurate. 

### Possible Graphs/Tables
A bar graph displaying the number of successful plays in each country would be a good example of data to analyze. Another example would be to create a table displaying the genres of plays that were most successful.
